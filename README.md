# Introduction
The XSM is a scientific instrument designed to carry out spectroscopic 
observations of the Sun with stable spectral performance over a
 wide range of solar intensities.

 A statistical/machine learning model and a web-based application was created to recognize and categorize X-ray bursts using open-source technologies.

 * This project was made under Mid-prep Problem Statement given by ISRO in Inter-IIT Tech Meet 10.0
